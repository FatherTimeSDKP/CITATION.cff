## 🔬 Overview

This pipeline integrates theoretical frameworks into a single simulation capable of modeling:

- Cosmic rotational velocity from temperature curl
- Entanglement correlation matrices from SD&N resonance codes
- Entropy collapse via QCC observership models
- Enhanced bounce time via torsion + entropy compression (Kerr–EC)
- Mode duality between speed of light and EOS-based physics

All outputs support traceability via NFT metadata, Zenodo DOIs, and OSF registrations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

SDKP tensor:T_sdkp = [Size, Density, Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy]
### SD&N Encoding:```python
sdn_id = (shape_code, dimension_shell, harmonic_number)
QCC Entropy Field:S(t, r) = S₀ · e^(-λt) · (1 + 0.01·sin(2πt/τ)) / (1 + r/R_H)
